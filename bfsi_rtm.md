**BFSIConfluenz-ShowCase2022...**

This document appears to be a showcase presentation or summary of a **Real-Time Monitoring (RTM)** tool developed for a client in the **Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI)** sector. The focus is on highlighting the **challenges** the client faced, the **solution provided**, and the **value it delivers**.

**Executive Summary:**

The executive summary sets the stage by outlining the **context** and the **core purpose** of the RTM tool.

**TANDEM-Based Application:** The foundation of the monitored system is **TANDEM**, a robust platform known for handling high-volume transaction processing. The RTM tool specifically targets **Debit Card and ATM transactions**.

**High Transaction Volume:** The system processes over **25 million transactions** on a daily basis, underscoring the critical need for effective monitoring.

**Limitations of Existing Monitoring (BASE24 TOMA):** The client previously relied on **BASE24's Real-time Monitoring (TOMA)** system. However, TOMA had a significant limitation: it couldn't provide a **unified, live view** of transactions across all critical channels, specifically **ATM and Point of Sale (POS)** systems. This lack of a **holistic real-time view** likely hindered proactive issue detection and troubleshooting.

**Reactive Alerting Mechanism:** The previous notification system was primarily triggered by **system failures or abnormal processing**. This meant that potential issues might only be identified **after they had already caused a disruption or anomaly**. This reactive approach likely led to **delays in addressing problems** and potentially impacted **service quality**. The dependency on the underlying systems for notifications also introduced a **point of failure**.

**Need for Business-Level Insights:** The **Service and Support teams**, as well as those managing the **payment switch application**, lacked readily available, **business-oriented insights** into transaction statistics. They needed a way to understand **transaction trends and performance** from a **business perspective**, not just a technical one. This would empower them to make **better decisions** and **proactively manage the system**.

**Purpose of the RTM Tool:** The newly developed RTM tool is presented as a **tactical solution** to address the identified limitations. Its primary goal is to provide a **user-friendly interface** that displays **key performance indicators (KPIs)** in a graphical format. These KPIs include:
- **Total Number of Transactions:** A fundamental metric indicating the overall activity.
- **Approval Rate:** A crucial indicator of transaction success and customer experience.
- **Transaction Volume:** Likely referring to the monetary value of transactions.
- **Transactions per Second (TPS):** A measure of the system's real-time processing capacity and potential bottlenecks.

**What were the pain areas & challenges?**

This section details the specific hurdles faced during the development and implementation of the RTM tool.

- **Data Transfer Bottleneck (TANDEM to Cloud):** A significant challenge was moving data from the legacy **TANDEM system** to the modern **cloud-based Virtual Machine (VM)** environment. The process was **manual** and lacked **automation** for scheduled transfers. This likely introduced **delays**, increased the **risk of errors**, and made **real-time analysis difficult**. The inability to seamlessly integrate the TANDEM data with the cloud platform was a **major impediment**.
- **Real-time Monitoring Accuracy in the Cloud:** Even with the move to the cloud, achieving **accurate real-time monitoring** posed a challenge. The existing tools struggled to provide an **up-to-the-minute view** of the data. The **latency** involved in transferring and processing data within the cloud storage environment made it difficult to meet the requirements for a **true real-time dashboard**.
- **Access Restrictions (Cloud Network & Client Software):** Initially, the development team faced difficulties in gaining the necessary **access to the cloud network** and the required **client software**. This administrative hurdle likely slowed down the **initial stages of the project** and prevented the team from starting the build process efficiently.
- **Data Retrieval Time (Original RTM Tool):** The original iteration of the RTM tool suffered from **slow data retrieval times** for the front-end dashboard. This would have negatively impacted the **user experience**, making it difficult to quickly identify and respond to critical situations. **Slow loading times** can diminish the value of a **real-time monitoring system**.

**How did you resolve it?**

This section outlines the **solutions and strategies** employed to overcome the identified challenges.

- **Unique Data Pipeline:** The team successfully created a **novel data pipeline** specifically designed to transfer logs from the **TANDEM system** to the **cloud-based Virtual Machine**. The use of **"best-in-class technologies"** suggests a well-architected and efficient data transfer mechanism. This likely involved **automation** to ensure **timely and reliable data availability** in the cloud.
- **Cloud Storage Provisioning:** The issue of **cloud storage limitations** was addressed by actively engaging with the **cloud provider**. By clearly outlining the **technical requirements** for the RTM tool, the team secured **adequate and optimized cloud storage resources** to support the application's needs.
- **Phased Access and Agile Implementation:** The **access restrictions** were resolved through a **pragmatic approach**. Initially, a small group of associates was granted **access to the cloud environment**. Once the **cloud network setup** was stable, access was extended to the **client Virtual Machine**. The team then adopted an **agile methodology**, building the tool directly within the **client VM** and subsequently migrating the entire setup to the **main cloud network**. This iterative approach likely allowed for **faster progress** and quicker resolution of access-related issues.
- **Ad-hoc Performance Improvement (Temporary Fix):** The **slow data retrieval issue** was addressed in the short term by implementing a **user-facing alert message**. This message informed users that there might be a **5-10 minute delay** in resolving requests, managing expectations while a **permanent solution** was being developed. The document explicitly states that a **permanent resolution** for this performance bottleneck will be addressed in **future enhancements**, indicating an ongoing commitment to improving the tool's responsiveness.

**Value delivered to Customers:**

This section highlights the **tangible benefits** and **positive outcomes** resulting from the implementation of the RTM tool.

- **Enhanced Monitoring Capabilities (Real-time, 24/7):** The tool provides the client with a significant upgrade in their **monitoring capabilities**. The **real-time nature** ensures that they have an **up-to-the-minute view** of their transaction processing. The **24/7 availability** means continuous monitoring, enabling them to **identify and respond to issues** at any time.
- **Improved Issue Detection (Proactive Risk Management):** The always-on monitoring and the ability to easily spot **issues and alerts** empower the client to move from a **reactive** to a more **proactive approach** to **risk management** and **failure prevention**. Early detection of anomalies can **minimize the impact** on customers and the business.
- **Graphical Representation of Key Metrics:** The dashboard provides valuable insights through **clear and concise graphical representations** of critical data points:
  - **Approval Rate of Transactions:** The trend line likely shows how the approval rate changes over time, allowing for the identification of any dips or anomalies that might indicate problems.
  - **Total Transaction Count:** The table breaks down the total transaction count by **"Transaction Type"** (e.g., Withdrawal, Purchase) and **"Status"** (e.g., Approved, Declined, Failed, Claim). This provides a detailed understanding of the types of transactions being processed and their outcomes.
  - **Transactions Per Second (TPS):** The graph illustrates the **real-time throughput** of the system, highlighting **peak loads** and potential **capacity issues**. Monitoring TPS is crucial for ensuring the system can handle the transaction volume.
  - **Transaction Volume per Response Code:** This visualization likely categorizes transaction volume based on the specific **response codes** received from the processing system. This can help identify patterns related to specific **errors or issues**.
